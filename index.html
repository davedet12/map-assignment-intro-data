        <p> The New York Police Department has been handing out twice as many summonses for fare evasion to Brooklynites than residents of Queens, despite the similar sizes of the two boroughs' populations, according to data collected by the NYPD. </p>

        <p> Brooklyn, which has a population of around 2.5 million people, received around 9,300 summonses during this period. On the other hand, Queens, which has a similar population of around 2.2 million people, received a little more than half that, at around 4,800 summonses. </p>

        <p> Summons rates are not useful for predicting the overall crime rates of a neighborhood, according to an article carried out by researchers at the John Jay Research and Evaluation Center. </p>

        <p> Fare evasion summons are tickets handed out by the NYPD and related agencies that charge people with breaking the law for having failed to make a payment when entering the subway, according to the MTA. </p> 

        <p> The data did not include summons handed out to riders of the Staten Island Railroad. </p>
